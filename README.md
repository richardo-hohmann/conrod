======

A graph based user interface with Boolean predicate search and flexible panel system written in Rust.

Here's an example of the c++ implementation of the nodal UI.

The plan is not to port all of it directly, but to closesly draw inspiration while implementing a much more powerful, searchable graph/node system.

# Goals

* Graph based navigation
* Boolean predicate search
